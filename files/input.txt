When I was fifteen, sixteen when I started really to play the guitar
I definately wanted to become a musician
It was almost impossible because the dream was so big
I didn't see any chance because I was living in a little town
[?] and when I finally broke away from school and became I musician
I thought well I may have a bit of a chance
Because all I every wanted to do is music but not only play music
But compose music.

At that time, in Germany, in 1969-70, they already had discotheques
So I would take my car and go to a discotheque and sing maybe 30 minutes
I think I had about 7-8 songs. I would partially sleep in the car
Because I didn't want to drive home and that help me for about almost 2 years
To survive. In the beginning, I wanted to do a album with the sound of the 50s, the sound of the 60s, of the 70s and then have a sound of the future.
